# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices using various machine learning models. The project includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building, as well as Python scripts for data handling and extraction.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building.
- **scripts/**: Contains Python scripts for data extraction and handling.
- **data/**: Directory to store sample data files (if necessary).

## Notebooks

- `company_data_analysis.ipynb`: Contains the analysis of company data.
- `stock_price_prediction_LSTM.ipynb`: Implements LSTM model for stock price prediction.
- `stock_analysis_and_prediction_GoldenCross.ipynb`: Analyzes stock prices using Golden Cross strategy.
- `stock_price_linear_regression.ipynb`: Uses linear regression for stock price prediction.

## Scripts

- `parse_html_to_csv.py`: Parses HTML data and converts it to CSV format.
- `yfinance_stock_data.py`: Extracts stock data using the yfinance API.
- `mysql_data_handler.py`: Handles data storage and retrieval using MySQL.

## Setup and Installation
